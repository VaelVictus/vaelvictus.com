<p>Fireburner is tinydark's second game. It is currently in production with an expected release date of Summer 2019.</p>

<p>Fireburner is what tinydark considers a "novella game", one which has a single core mechanic and is completable in 2-3 sessions. In Fireburner, you maintain the health of a fire while keeping your own health in mind. If the fire goes out, the Elden Crow arrives to consume you. The player may choose to spend their time exploring and risk facing their demise, or take it easy in camp and hope to eke out a victory.</p>

<p>A key feature of Fireburner is its responsive nature soundscape. The soundscape reacts to the decisions you make: hunting too much results in a quiet world. The fire roars as you stoke it to greater heights. You'll hear rain, streams of water, and the chop of wood as you swing the axe.</p>

<p>It began as a demonstration of how quickly a developer can implement an idea in the GAM3 engine. Early into development, my mind wandered and I began to flesh out the world. I had some quests in mind that didn't fit into other games, so I decided to hunker down and worldbuild. It's a game about creation, nature, and dark entropy. Coming soon. :}</p>
